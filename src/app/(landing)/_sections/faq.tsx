      question: "What is this website for?",
      answer: (
        <span>
          This is a free, lightweight tool for creating tree tests. It&apos;s a simpler alternative
          to UXTweak and Optimal Workshop, built by a solo developer. Not every feature is here yet,
          but I&apos;m actively improving it. A future overhaul will add more capabilities like card
          sorting, first-click testing, and more.

    //   question: "Why is it called UsabiliTree?",
    //   answer: (
    //     <span>
    //       UsabiliTree is a portmanteau of usability and tree. It&apos;s a play on the words
    //       usability and tree test. At first, I only wanted to build a tree test tool and bought that
    //       domain name, but I decided to add a card sort tool as well.
    //     </span>

      question: "Is this tool free?",
      answer: (
        <span>
          Yes, everything is free. You can create up to 7 tree tests with unlimited participants.

      question: "Where is the demo?",
      answer: (
        <span>
          There is no demo. However, when you sign up, you&apos;ll see a sample active study in your
          dashboard to help you get familiar with tree testing. Please be guided by the onboarding
          flow—it&apos;s designed to walk you through the basics. If you choose &quot;No, I&apos;ll
          explore myself&quot;, you can still refer back to the sample study anytime.
